<light> The main goal behind this was to create a front end responcive website that is user friendly. I designed the website the way I did so everything the user needs to see or use is right in front of them and is easy access.
I picked this particular website because I have a great intrest in content creation and design. I wanted to showcase some of my photos and videos I have shot and edited over the last few years i have been travelling. </light>


# <strong>UX</strong>
I picked this particular website because I have a great intrest in content creation and design. I wanted to showcase some of my photos and videos I have shot and edited over the last few years I have been travelling. I want the user to have everything infront of them so they dont have to be going through diffrent pages. The target audience I am looking for would mostly be models looking for potrait shots and advertising companies who want to advertise a certain location or brand/item.

## <strong>In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:</strong>
* Easy access and user friendly interface.
* A reponsive nav-bar.
* Responcive photos that can be viewed at a wider scale.
* A sample video I have shot and edited.
* A link to my social media accounts to view more content.
