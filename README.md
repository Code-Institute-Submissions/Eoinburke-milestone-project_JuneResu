<light> The main goal behind this was to create a front end responcive website that is user friendly. I designed the website the way I did so everything the user needs to see or use is right in front of them and is easy access.
I picked this particular website because I have a great intrest in content creation and design. I wanted to showcase some of my photos and videos I have shot and edited over the last few years i have been travelling. </light>


# <strong>UX</strong>
I picked this particular website because I have a great intrest in content creation and design. I wanted to showcase some of my photos and videos I have shot and edited over the last few years I have been travelling. I want the user to have everything infront of them so they dont have to be going through diffrent pages. The target audience I am looking for would mostly be models looking for potrait shots and advertising companies who want to advertise a certain location or brand/item.

## <strong>In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:</strong>
* Easy access and user friendly interface.
* A reponsive nav-bar.
* Responcive photos that can be viewed at a wider scale.
* A sample video I have shot and edited.
* A link to my social media accounts to view more content.

# <strong>Website Features</strong>
## [Home](https://eoinburke.github.io/milestone-project/index.html) 
* Narbar - When developing the website I added a sticky navigation bar, I did this to make the website user friendly and easy to navigate through. 
* Image slider - I designed my website with an image slider to grab the users attention, hoping they will want so see more content.
* Modal -  I added modal to my log in/sign up button to make the website that bit more interactive.

## Content
* Fancy box - When I was incorporating images into my webpage I wanted the user to be able to browse through the content freely. Fancy box was the best tool I could use it allows users to play through the images and have easy access to scroll through them.
